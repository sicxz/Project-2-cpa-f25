- You'd rather work independently that week

**This is flexible—use it as needed.**

## Getting the Most Out of Peer Feedback

**When asking for feedback:**
- Be specific about what you want help with
- Show your work, don't just describe it
- Be open to suggestions you didn't expect

**When giving feedback:**
- Ask clarifying questions first
- Offer ideas, not directives
- Connect to your own experience
- Be constructively critical

**Remember:**
- Peers aren't evaluating your work (only you and instructor do that)
- Their role is to support your learning
- You decide what feedback to use

---

## Alternative: Online Check-Ins

**If in-person doesn't work for you:**
- Share updates in a class Discord/Slack (if set up)
- Exchange Milanote links with peers async
- Schedule virtual co-working sessions
- Create small accountability groups

**The format matters less than the support.**

---

## This is Optional

Some students thrive on weekly peer interaction. Others prefer working solo and check in occasionally. Both are fine.

**Use these sessions if they help you:**
- Stay accountable
- Get unstuck
- Feel connected
- Learn from peers
- Practice articulating your work

**Skip them if:**
- You're more productive working independently
- You prefer one-on-one meetings with instructor
- Your schedule doesn't allow it
- It doesn't fit your working style

**There's no attendance requirement and no grade impact.**

These discussions exist solely to support your learning however works best for you.

## Questions?

If you want to set up peer discussions but aren't sure how to structure them, talk to Travis or propose a format to your classmates.

The best structure is whatever helps you all learn and support each other.
