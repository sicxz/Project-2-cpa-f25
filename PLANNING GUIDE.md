← [Back to Project Brief](PROJECT%20BRIEF.md)

**For:** Weeks 4-5 (Planning Phase)

---

## TL;DR

**Your mission:** Design a 7-week independent study plan using AI as your collaborator.

**What you'll create:**
1. Week-by-week study plan (Weeks 6-11)
2. Research paper plan with reading list (12-18 sources)
3. Documentation strategy
4. Final deliverable vision
5. Complete Milanote board with everything organized

**Time estimate:** 6-8 hours spread across 2 weeks

**No prescribed method:** Use AI however works for you—conversational, structured, iterative, whatever helps you design a strong plan.

**Due:** End of Week 5

---

## Why Planning Matters

Two weeks of thoughtful planning sets you up for six weeks of productive work.

**A strong plan means:**
- Clear direction when you start making
- Realistic timeline that avoids overwhelm
- Reading list that deepens understanding
- Tangible outcome you're excited to create

**Rush planning = struggle during execution. Invest in planning = thrive while making.**

---

## Three-Step Planning Process

### **STEP 1: Design Your 7-Week Study**

Use AI to help you map out what you'll explore and create over 6 weeks (Weeks 6-11).

#### **How to approach this:**

**Option A: Conversational Design**

Open a conversation with your preferred AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini):

```
"I want to design a 7-week independent study exploring [your design focus from Project 1].

I'm interested in [specific aspects/tools/questions].

Can you help me think through:
- What's realistic to accomplish in 6 weeks?
- How should I structure this week by week?
- What tools and techniques should I focus on?
- What would make this meaningful rather than superficial?"
```

Let the conversation evolve. Ask follow-up questions. Push back when suggestions don't fit. Iterate together.

**Option B: Structured Brainstorming**

Ask AI to help you generate possibilities:

```
"Generate 5 different approaches to exploring [your focus] over 6 weeks.

For each approach, include:
- Week-by-week goals
- Tools/techniques used
- Final deliverable
- Complexity level (beginner-friendly to advanced)

I want to see options ranging from focused-and-deep to broad-and-exploratory."
```

Review the options. Mix and match elements. Create your own version.

**Option C: Iterative Refinement**

Draft your own initial plan, then ask AI to critique it:

```
"Here's my draft 7-week plan: [paste your plan]

Please evaluate:
- Is the scope realistic for 6 weeks?
- Are weekly goals specific enough?
- What's missing?
- What could be stronger?
- Any red flags or concerns?"
```

Revise based on feedback. Repeat until it feels solid.

---

#### **What your study plan should include:**

**For each week (Weeks 6-11), define:**

**Week 6: Getting Started**
- Initial tool exploration and setup
- First experiments and tests
- Getting comfortable with your tools
- Setting up documentation workflow

**Week 7: Going Deeper**
- First prototypes or creative outputs
- Expanding techniques
- Addressing initial challenges
- Building on Week 6 discoveries

**Week 8: Refinement & Iteration**
- Refining approaches based on learning
- Experimenting with variations
- Solving technical problems
- Deeper engagement with tools

**Week 9: Integration & Synthesis**
- Bringing pieces together
- Connecting research and making
- Applying insights from readings
- Building toward final vision

**Week 10: Polishing & Expanding**
- Refining quality of work
- Expanding scope where successful
- Addressing gaps
- Preparing for final deliverable

**Week 11: Finalizing & Presenting**
- Final refinements
- Completing documentation
- Building final deliverable (website, portfolio, etc.)
- Preparing presentation

**For each week, specify:**
- **Primary goal** - What's the main focus this week?
- **Specific activities** - What will you actually do?
- **Tools/techniques** - Which AI tools and design platforms?
- **Output** - What will you create/produce?
- **Success indicator** - How will you know you're progressing?

---

#### **Reality check your plan:**

**Ask yourself:**
- Can I realistically accomplish this in 6 weeks?
- Am I trying to do too much?
- Is each week building on the previous week?
- Do I have buffer time for challenges?
- Will this lead to something meaningful?

**Red flags:**
- Trying to master 5+ new tools
- Every week feels like starting from scratch
- No connection between weeks
- Final deliverable requires more than Week 11
- Reading 20+ dense academic papers

**Green flags:**
- Focus on 2-3 core tools/techniques
- Clear progression from week to week
- Build-in time for iteration and mistakes
- Final deliverable is ambitious but achievable
- Reading list is diverse and manageable

---

### **STEP 2: Build Your Reading List & Research Paper Plan**

Design the research component that will run alongside your creative work.

#### **Choose your research direction:**

Your research paper can:
- **Directly relate** to your creative exploration (e.g., exploring AI video tools → researching AI in motion design practice)
- **Connect thematically** (e.g., making brand identities → researching AI's impact on design authenticity)
- **Pursue a separate interest** (e.g., building tools → researching AI ethics in design)

Pick what will be most meaningful and sustainable for 6 weeks.

---

#### **Formulate your research question:**

**Strong research questions are:**
- **Specific:** Not "How does AI impact design?" but "How are professional studios integrating AI video tools into production workflows?"
- **Explorable:** You can find sources that address this
- **Interesting:** You genuinely want to know the answer
- **Connected:** Links to design practice somehow

**Use AI to help refine:**

```
"I'm interested in researching [broad topic] for my design class.

Can you help me narrow this into a specific, researchable question?

My creative focus is [your Project 1 focus].
I'm working with [tools/techniques you chose].

Generate 5 different research questions I could explore, ranging from practical to theoretical."
```

Pick the one that excites you most.

---

#### **Curate 12-18 sources:**

**Target:** 2-3 sources per week for Weeks 6-11

**Mix of source types:**
- ~40% Academic (journal articles, book chapters, research papers)
- ~40% Practitioner (design essays, case studies, tool documentation, studio blogs)
- ~20% Media (podcasts, video talks, interviews)

**Strategic progression:**
- **Weeks 6-7:** Foundation (background, key concepts, historical context)
- **Weeks 8-9:** Application (case studies, methodologies, critical analysis)
- **Weeks 10-11:** Contemporary (current developments, future implications)

---

#### **Use AI to help find sources:**

```
"I'm researching: [your research question]

I need to curate 12-18 high-quality sources for a 6-week reading schedule.

Can you suggest:
1. 5-6 academic papers or book chapters
2. 5-6 practitioner essays, case studies, or tool documentations
3. 3-4 podcast episodes, video talks, or interviews

For each source, provide:
- Full citation (author, title, year, publication)
- One-sentence description of relevance
- Why this source is important

Focus on recent sources (2020-2025) unless there are foundational older works."
```

**CRITICAL:** Verify every source actually exists. AI sometimes invents citations.

**Check accessibility:** Can you actually get these sources? Use university library, Google Scholar, or contact authors.

---

#### **Plan your writing strategy:**

**How will you develop the paper with AI?**

Choose your approach:
- **ChatGPT Canvas** - Iterative document editing with AI
- **Claude Artifacts** - Collaborative document development
- **Gemini Docs** - Research and writing assistance
- **Your own method** - Whatever works for you

**Plan your timeline:**
- Weeks 6-7: Reading and note-taking, draft outline
- Weeks 8-9: Draft sections, iterative writing with AI
- Week 10: Complete draft, major revisions
- Week 11: Final polish, citations, formatting

**Target:** 3,000-5,000 word research paper reflecting YOUR voice and thinking (AI as partner, not author)

---

### **STEP 3: Plan Your Documentation & Final Deliverable**

Decide how you'll track progress and what you'll create by Week 11.

#### **Documentation Strategy:**

**How will you capture your learning?**

**Visual note-taking:**
- Sketches and diagrams of concepts
- Annotated screenshots of experiments
- Visual mind maps connecting ideas
- Process documentation photos/videos

**Milanote organization:**
- Weekly boards (one per week)
- Reading response sections
- Process documentation sections
- Reflection and insights sections
- Clear visual hierarchy and navigation

**Reading responses:**
- Key quotes with your reactions
- Connections to your creative work
- Questions raised by the reading
- Diagrams or sketches of concepts

**Process documentation:**
- Screenshots of experiments (successful and failed)
- Notes on what you're learning
- Technical discoveries and challenges
- Iteration documentation

**Weekly reflection:**
- What worked this week?
- What didn't work?
- What surprised you?
- What's next?

**The goal:** Show your learning journey, not just your polished outputs.

---

---

## Using AI Effectively

### **Different Approaches to Try:**

**1. The Socratic Partner**
Ask AI to question your assumptions:
```
"I'm thinking about [your idea].

Instead of just agreeing, challenge me:
- What am I not considering?
- Where might this go wrong?
- What would make this stronger?
- What's the weakest part of this plan?"
```

**2. The Structured Planner**
Use AI to generate frameworks:
```
"Create a detailed project planning framework for a 6-week [your focus] study.

Include:
- Weekly goals template
- Progress tracking methods
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Quality checkpoints"
```

**3. The Research Assistant**
Get help finding materials:
```
"I need to find sources on [your topic].

Help me:
1. Identify key authors and publications in this area
2. Find 3 foundational academic papers
3. Suggest 3 practitioner blogs or studios to follow
4. Recommend 2 podcasts or video channels"
```

**4. The Reality Checker**
Test your timeline:
```
"Here's what I'm planning to accomplish in Week 6: [your plan]

Is this realistic for 7 days of work?
What could go wrong?
What am I underestimating?"
```

---

### **Document Your Process:**

In your reflection, note:
- Which AI model(s) you used
- What approach worked best
- How AI helped clarify your thinking
- Where you pushed back on AI suggestions
- How the collaboration shaped your plan

**Remember:** AI is a tool to enhance your thinking, not replace it.

## Common Planning Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Too Ambitious**
- Trying to master 5 different AI tools
- Planning to read 30 sources
- Unrealistic weekly goals

**Fix:** Focus and depth over breadth. Master 2-3 things deeply.

**Mistake 2: Too Vague**
- "Explore Midjourney"
- "Learn about AI"
- "Make some designs"

**Fix:** Be specific. "Create a brand identity system using Midjourney with style consistency techniques."

**Mistake 3: No Connection Between Weeks**
- Every week feels random
- No building on previous work
- No progression

**Fix:** Each week should build on discoveries from the previous week.

**Mistake 4: All Making, No Research** (or vice versa)
- No reading list
- OR no creative component

**Fix:** Balance both. Let research inform making. Let making raise research questions.

**Mistake 5: Final Deliverable as Afterthought**
- "I'll figure that out later"
- No plan for building it
- Too complex to complete in Week 11

**Fix:** Plan the final deliverable now. Build it incrementally during Weeks 9-11.

---
