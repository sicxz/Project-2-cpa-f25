# Checkpoint Guides

← [Back to Project Brief](PROJECT%20BRIEF.md)

**Purpose:** Detailed guidance for the two major project checkpoints

---

## TL;DR

**Two checkpoints keep your project on track:**

1. **Week 5 (End of Planning):** Submit complete plan for approval (REQUIRED to proceed)
2. **Week 11 (Final):** Submit all deliverables + present to class

**These aren't busywork—they're support structures** ensuring you start strong and finish successfully.

---

## Checkpoint 1: Week 5 - Project Plan Submission

---

### **What Happens After Submission**

**Within 2-3 days, you'll receive:**

#### **APPROVED ✓**
- Confirmation to proceed to Week 6 execution
- Any minor suggestions or considerations
- Encouragement and support
- You can immediately begin execution

#### **APPROVED WITH MINOR REVISIONS**
- Specific small adjustments needed
- Quick guidance on fixes
- Typically 1-2 day revision deadline
- Usually just scope tweaks or source additions

#### **NEEDS REVISION** (Rare)
- Fundamental issues that require rethinking
- Meeting scheduled to discuss alternatives
- Clear guidance on what needs to change
- Cannot proceed until revised and approved

**Most plans are approved or approved with minor revisions.** If you follow the Planning Guide and come to office hours with questions, you'll be in good shape.

---

### **Common Reasons for Revision Requests**

#### **Scope Issues**
- **Too broad:** "Explore AI and design" → Need specific focus
- **Too narrow:** "Create 3 logos" → Need research dimension and depth
- **Unrealistic:** Trying to master 5 tools + read 25 sources + build 3 websites

**Fix:** Choose 2-3 core tools/techniques. Go deep, not broad.

#### **Reading List Problems**
- Fewer than 12 sources or more than 18
- All sources from one type (all blogs, no academic)
- Sources don't clearly relate to research question
- Can't access sources (check before submitting)

**Fix:** Ensure 12-18 diverse sources you can actually read.

#### **Vague Deliverables**
- "I'll make something with AI" → What specifically?
- "Explore tools" → What will you create by Week 11?
- No plan for building final deliverable

**Fix:** Be specific about final format, components, and build timeline.

#### **Week-by-Week Plan Issues**
- Weeks are too vague ("explore Midjourney")
- No progression or connection between weeks
- No buffer time for challenges
- Final deliverable entirely crammed into Week 11

**Fix:** Specific weekly goals that build on each other. Start final deliverable by Week 9.

#### **Weak Research Question**
- Too generic or broad
- Not connected to any making/practice
- Can't be explored through available sources

**Fix:** Make it specific, connected to design practice, and researchable.

---

### **Getting Feedback Before Submission**

**Highly recommended:**
- Share draft Milanote with instructor 2-3 days before deadline
- Come to office hours during Weeks 4-5 to discuss ideas
- Get peer feedback on your plan

**Early feedback = fewer revision requests = faster approval**

---

### **After Approval: Week 6 Begins**

Once approved, you're cleared to start execution:

**Immediately:**
- Begin your first week's readings
- Start tool exploration and experiments
- Set up your comprehensive Milanote documentation

**Week 6 focus:**
- Getting comfortable with your chosen tools
- First experiments and tests
- Setting up documentation workflow
- Building momentum

**You're now executing the plan you designed!**

---

## Checkpoint 2: Week 11 - Final Presentation & Deliverables

## Checkpoint Summary

| Checkpoint | When | What | Purpose |
|------------|------|------|---------|
| **1. Plan Submission** | End of Week 5 | Complete Milanote planning board | Get approval to proceed with execution |
| **2. Final Deliverables** | End of Week 11 | Research paper, creative work, documentation, presentation | Demonstrate complete learning journey |

---

## Final Thoughts on Checkpoints

**Week 5 approval ensures:** You start execution with a solid foundation

**Week 11 deliverables demonstrate:** Your ability to plan, execute, research, create, and reflect independently

**These checkpoints are support structures**, not barriers. They're designed to help you succeed.

**Take them seriously:**
- Plan thoroughly for Week 5
- Execute consistently Weeks 6-10
- Finish strong in Week 11

**Questions or concerns?** Reach out to Travis anytime during the process.
