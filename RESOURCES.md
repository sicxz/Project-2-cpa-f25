- Try different models/tools
- Study effective prompts in tool communities

**"Results are inconsistent"**
- Solution: Use seed numbers (if available), document effective prompts
- Build style guides to reference
- Iterate methodically, changing one variable at a time

**"I don't have access to [tool]"**
- Solution: Find alternatives with similar capabilities
- Use free tiers creatively
- Ask instructor about educational licenses

**"I'm spending too much time/money on AI tools"**
- Solution: Be more strategic about when to generate
- Use free alternatives where possible
- Focus on quality over quantity

---

### **Research Problems**

**"I can't access academic papers"**
- Solution: Use university library proxies
- Try Google Scholar for free versions
- Email authors directly (often works!)
- Use Sci-Hub (gray area legally)
- Ask instructor for PDF

**"Papers are too technical"**
- Solution: Start with abstract and conclusion
- Use AI to summarize (but then engage with actual content)
- Find practitioner summaries of research
