## TL;DR

**What:** Design a 7-week independent study exploring ANY AI + Design topic you want.

**This assignment (Weeks 4-5):** Create the plan using AI as your collaborator. Use AI however works for you—no prescribed methods.

**Next (Weeks 6-11):** Execute your plan. Make stuff. Research. Create.

**Deliverable:** Milanote board with your complete plan including:
- 7-week study breakdown (what you'll explore/create each week)
- Research paper plan with reading list (12-18 sources)
- Documentation strategy
- Vision for final deliverable

**The point:** Design your own learning journey. Practice professional autonomy. Use AI as a creative partner in planning (and later, making).

## Overview

You've defined your personal design focus in Project 1. Now it's time to design your own learning journey.

**This is not a predetermined assignment.** You decide:
- What you'll explore and create
- Which tools you'll use
- How deep you'll go
- What your final outcome will be

**Your job this week:** Use AI to help you design a meaningful, achievable 7-week plan.

**Next 6 weeks:** Execute what you designed.

## What You'll Create (Weeks 4-5)

### **1. Seven-Week Study Plan**

Design your weeks 6-11 learning journey.

**For each week, define:**
- **What you'll explore/create** - Be specific about goals and experiments
- **Tools you'll use** - Which AI tools, design platforms, etc.
- **How you'll document** - Screenshots, sketches, notes, process videos
- **How you'll know you're progressing** - What does success look like each week?

**Think through:**
- Week 6: Getting started, tool exploration, initial experiments
- Week 7: Going deeper, first prototypes
- Week 8: Refinement and iteration
- Week 9: Integration and synthesis
- Week 10: Polishing and expanding
- Week 11: Finalizing and presenting

**Balance ambition with realism.** You want to be challenged but not overwhelmed.

---

### **2. Research Paper Plan**

Design a research paper you'll develop alongside your creative work.

**Your paper can:**
- Directly relate to your creative exploration
- Explore a related theoretical question
- Investigate a separate topic that interests you

**Plan includes:**

**Research Topic/Question:**
- What will you research and write about?
- Why does this interest you?
- How does it connect to design practice?

**Reading Schedule (12-18 sources for Weeks 6-11):**
- 2-3 readings, videos, or podcasts per week
- Mix of academic sources, practitioner essays, and media
- Strategic progression from foundation → application → contemporary

**Development Strategy:**
- How will you develop the paper with AI?
- Which tools will you use? (Canvas, Artifacts, Gemini, etc.)
- How will you ensure it reflects YOUR voice and thinking?
- What's your writing timeline?

**Target:** 3,000-5,000 word research paper by Week 11

---

### **3. Documentation Strategy**

How will you track your progress over 6 weeks?

**Decide on:**
- **Visual note-taking approach** - Sketches, diagrams, annotated screenshots?
- **Milanote organization** - How will you structure your weekly boards?
- **Reading responses** - How will you engage with sources?
- **Process documentation** - What will you capture as you work?
- **Reflection method** - How will you analyze your learning?

**The goal:** Create evidence of your learning journey, not just final products.

---

### **4. Final Deliverable Vision**

What will you create by Week 11?

**Options include:**
- **Portfolio website** showcasing your work and research (built with Figma, Claude Code, no-code tool, hand-coded)
- **Research paper + visual portfolio** (Milanote, PDF, interactive doc)
- **Tool or prototype** you've built (Custom GPT, agent system, design tool)
- **Creative artifact + documentation** (video, interactive experience, design system)
- **Your own idea** that makes sense for your focus

**Be specific:** What will someone see/experience when they view your final work?

---

## How to Use AI in This Process

**There's no prescribed method.** Use AI however makes sense to you:

### **Conversational Approach**
Open a conversation with Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini:
- "I want to design a 7-week independent study exploring [your focus]. Can you help me think through how to structure this?"
- Let the conversation evolve naturally
- Ask follow-up questions
- Push back when suggestions don't fit

### **Structured Brainstorming**
Ask AI to help you:
- Generate week-by-week possibilities
- Suggest tools and techniques
- Identify potential readings and resources
- Reality-check your timeline

### **Iterative Refinement**
- Draft your plan
- Ask AI to critique it
- Revise based on feedback
- Repeat until it feels right

### **Multi-Model Comparison**
- Ask the same planning question to multiple models
- Compare their suggestions
- Synthesize the best ideas

### **Your Own Approach**
Use AI in whatever way helps you design a strong plan.

**What matters:** The quality of your plan, not the method you used to create it.

**Document your process:** Include notes about how AI helped in your reflection.

## Getting Started

### **Step 1: Review Your Design Focus**
Look back at Project 1. What did you identify as your area of interest?

### **Step 2: Open a Conversation with AI**
Choose Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or another LLM and start exploring:
- What could you create in 7 weeks?
- What would make this meaningful?
- What's ambitious but achievable?

### **Step 3: Design Your 7-Week Journey**
Map out weeks 6-11 with specific goals and activities.

### **Step 4: Build Your Reading List**
Find 12-18 sources that will deepen your understanding. Use AI to help discover relevant materials.

### **Step 5: Organize Everything in Milanote**
Create a clear, visual presentation of your plan.

### **Step 6: Reflect and Refine**
Step back. Does this excite you? Is it realistic? Will it lead somewhere meaningful?

## Tips for Success

### **Balance Ambition with Realism**
- You have 6 weeks to execute this
- Better to go deep on less than shallow on more
- Build in buffer time for challenges

### **Connect Making and Thinking**
- Don't just make things without research
- Don't just read without making
- Let each inform the other

### **Use Your Interests**
- Choose something you genuinely want to explore
- If it doesn't excite you now, it won't in Week 9
- This should connect to your design practice or career goals

### **Plan for Documentation**
- Future you will thank present you for good notes
- Capture process, not just outcomes
- Document failures and pivots—they're part of learning

### **Be Specific**
- Vague plans lead to vague results
- "Explore Midjourney" → "Create a brand identity system using Midjourney with consistent visual style"
- "Read about AI" → "Research industry perspectives on AI in professional illustration practice"

---

## Why This Matters

In your design career, you'll constantly need to:
- **Identify learning opportunities** without explicit direction
- **Design your own skill development** based on emerging needs
- **Evaluate and adopt new tools** strategically
- **Balance making with research and theory**
- **Manage long-term independent projects**

This is practice for that **professional autonomy**.

You're not just learning about AI tools—you're learning **how to learn** independently, **how to plan** strategically, and **how to create** meaningfully.

These are the skills that sustain a design career.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Can I change my plan after it's approved?**
Minor adjustments are fine as you learn and discover. Major changes should be discussed with instructor.

### **How do I know if my scope is right?**
Ask yourself: Could I complete this in 6 weeks while also writing a research paper? If unsure, come to office hours.

### **Do I have to use AI for everything?**
No—AI is a tool, not a requirement. Use it where it helps. Your creative judgment is essential.

### **What if I don't know what to explore yet?**
That's normal! Start a conversation with AI about your interests. Browse tools. Look at what others are creating. Your plan doesn't have to be perfect—it just needs to be thoughtful and achievable.

### **Can I work with peers?**
You can discuss ideas and share resources, but your plan and execution must be your own individual work.

### **How much time should I spend weekly during execution?**
Plan for 8-10 hours per week during Weeks 6-11 (creative work, readings, documentation).
